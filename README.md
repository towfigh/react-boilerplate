This repository has the Basic requirements for building a React application. At first I made this repository for myself because I was exhausted of repetitive and forgettable tasks. Then I decided to publish it. The following technologies are used in this repository, which are widely used in building a React application :

* React
* Bootsrtap
* Redux
* Redux-thunk
* Redux-persist
* Redux-persist-transform-encrypt (to encrypt stored data in local storage)
* redux-devtools-extension
* SASS
* React-router
